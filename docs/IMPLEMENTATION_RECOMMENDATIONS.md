# Implementation Recommendations Checklist

These recommendations prioritise workstreams that keep Nova's agent orchestration delivery on track. Each checklist item can be
expanded into detailed tasks within the project management tooling.

## 1. Integration & Security Reviews
- [ ] Define integration review checkpoints for every major milestone.
- [ ] Embed security review criteria early in the development schedule to catch risks before release candidates.
- [ ] Assign owners for integration and security review follow-ups to prevent unresolved findings.

## 2. Roadmap Milestones & Definition of Done
- [ ] Add explicit milestones to the roadmap for each agent role (planner, coder, tester, ops, etc.).
- [ ] Draft a "Definition of Done" per agent role that captures quality gates, documentation and handoff expectations.
- [ ] Link each milestone to measurable metrics so progress remains auditable.

## 3. Test Automation & Monitoring Stability
- [ ] Run automated test suites in CI/CD for every orchestration update and capture trend reports.
- [ ] Expand monitoring coverage (log aggregation, alert thresholds) to detect regressions during the final delivery phase.
- [ ] Document incident response playbooks for late-stage stability issues.
