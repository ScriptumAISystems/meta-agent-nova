# Projekt Aurora Claim Review

## Summary
- [ ] Claim verified
- [x] Claim **not** verified
- Reason: The `meta-agent-nova` repository does not contain the referenced Bash scripts or variables. No evidence of `%USERPROFILE%` being used in Bash or NVIDIA driver version parsing exists in the current codebase.

## Investigation Steps
1. Searched the repository for `%USERPROFILE%` to identify any Bash scripts that might create incorrect Windows paths.
2. Looked for occurrences of `python -m venv` to confirm whether virtual environment creation scripts exist.
3. Searched for NVIDIA-specific identifiers such as `NVRM` to locate any driver version checks.
4. Reviewed project directories for assets named after "Aurora".

## Findings
- The search returned no matches for `%USERPROFILE%`, indicating that no Bash scripts use the Windows-specific environment variable that triggered the reported Codex P1 issue.
- No scripts invoking `python -m venv` were present, so there is no evidence of the virtual environment setup code described in the claim.
- The repository does not contain any references to NVIDIA driver checks (`NVRM`), nor are there files that parse driver versions with `awk`.
- Global searches for "Aurora" yielded zero results, suggesting that "Projekt-Aurora" artifacts are absent from the codebase.

## Conclusion
The claim that two Codex reviews for Projekt Aurora highlighted P1 bugs in this repository cannot be substantiated. None of the referenced scripts or problematic patterns are present in the `meta-agent-nova` project. Consequently, the bug reports and associated fix snippets do not apply to the current codebase.
