# Meta-Agent Nova â€“ Codex Superprompt

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Build Nova as the orchestration layer that coordinates sub-agents (finance, design, legal, vision AI) and optimizes their collaboration across Spark Sophia and Aetherius Bridge.

## ðŸ§© Tasks for Codex
1. **Task-Graph Engine**
   - Support hierarchical tasks, lifecycle states (RUNNING, FAILED, SUCCESS), and dependency resolution.
2. **Reflections Layer**
   - Analyze sub-agent performance using combined log and vector signals.
3. **Spark Integration API**
   - Control and status exchange via the Aetherius Bridge.
4. **Self-Optimization Policies**
   - Implement rules that adapt agent resource allocation.
5. **UI / CLI Surface**
   - Provide `nova status` and `nova assign agent <id>` commands for operator control.

## âœ… Definition of Done
- Nova operates as a functional meta-coordinator with authority over connected agents.
- Dedicated policy and reflection modules drive continuous optimization.
