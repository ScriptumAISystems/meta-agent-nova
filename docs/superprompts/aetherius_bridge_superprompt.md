# Aetherius Bridge ‚Äì Codex Superprompt

## üéØ Goal
Deliver a low-latency mTLS-secured bridge that connects Cloud-Sophia with the on-prem Spark Sophia under strict security policies.

## üîê Security Baseline
- mTLS with continuous token rotation.
- Whitelist-driven actions enforced via OPA bundle v0.1.
- Resource quotas with automated kill-switch.
- WORM logs with signal/email alerting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks for Codex
1. **Core Modules**
   - `control_channel.py`: implement mTLS handshake and rotation.
   - `event_bus.py`: define JSON schemas and topic routing.
   - `policy_enforcer.py`: evaluate OPA policies and whitelist rules.
   - `logger.py`: produce WORM hash-chained logs with audit proofs.
2. **Transport Adapter (Phase 2)**
   - Build gRPC/QUIC layer for resilient transport.
3. **Vault Integration**
   - Automate key rotation and offline archival workflows.
4. **Smoke Tests & Runbook**
   - Provide start/stop procedures, sandbox validation, and kill-switch testing.

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done
- Auditable bridge with full mTLS flow, enforced OPA whitelist, and automated negative tests.
- Production-ready connection path between Cloud and DGX Spark environments.
