# Spark Hardware Migration Plan

Nova's next roadmap milestone is to prepare migration to the Spark hardware
stack. This plan structures the work into auditable checklists so that the
team can move from local validation towards production deployment with clear
handoffs and rollback paths.

## 1. Environment Readiness
- [ ] Confirm target Spark cluster specifications (GPU type, storage tiers,
      network topology) and map them to Nova's baseline requirements.
- [ ] Reserve the staging and production namespaces required for Nova, agent
      services and shared observability tooling.
- [ ] Align firmware, NVIDIA driver and CUDA versions between current test
      systems and the Spark hardware to avoid runtime drift.

## 2. Access & Security Controls
- [ ] Provision federated identities, VPN/WireGuard profiles and role-based
      access for Nova maintainers and CI/CD robots.
- [ ] Configure hardware security modules or sealed secrets management for
      credentials used by the orchestrator and its agents.
- [ ] Validate network segmentation, firewall rules and mTLS certificates for
      inter-agent communication once deployed on Spark.

## 3. Deployment Automation
- [ ] Adapt the existing container build pipeline to produce images optimised
      for the Spark GPU layout (multi-arch manifests, MIG profiles if needed).
- [ ] Generate Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts that capture Nova, task queue,
      monitoring stack and data services with Spark-specific resource limits.
- [ ] Extend CI/CD (Chronos focus) to run smoke deployments against the Spark
      staging cluster before promoting artefacts to production.

## 4. Data & Service Migration
- [ ] Plan the migration path for databases and vector stores managed by
      Lumina, including backup snapshots, transfer bandwidth estimates and
      cut-over sequencing.
- [ ] Define data residency, encryption at rest and retention requirements to
      remain compliant when moving to Spark-managed storage.
- [ ] Test synchronisation jobs for knowledge bases to ensure failback to the
      previous environment remains possible during the transition window.

## 5. Validation & Observability
- [ ] Execute Nova's full orchestration test suite on the Spark staging
      hardware and capture performance baselines for CPU, GPU and network.
- [ ] Enable Aura's dashboards (Grafana, LUX) to monitor migration KPIs such as
      deployment duration, resource saturation and error budgets.
- [ ] Collect security and compliance evidence (audit logs, policy decisions)
      to support the scheduled integration and security reviews.

## 6. Rollback & Cut-Over Management
- [ ] Draft rollback procedures that detail how to revert agent services to the
      previous environment within defined RTO/RPO targets.
- [ ] Schedule a migration rehearsal with all agent owners (Nova, Orion,
      Lumina, Echo, Chronos, Aura) to validate coordination and communication
      channels.
- [ ] Confirm post-migration support windows, on-call rotations and reporting
      cadence before executing the production cut-over.

Once the checklists reach "done", update the README roadmap entry and inform
stakeholders via the orchestration status report so the next governance gates
can commence.
