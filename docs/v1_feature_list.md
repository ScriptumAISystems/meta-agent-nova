# Meta-Agent Nova v1.0 Feature List

This catalogue defines the functional scope for the v1.0 release of the Nova orchestration stack. It links the roadmap priorities to concrete, testable outcomes per agent role so the team can plan delivery, QA and release sign-off with shared expectations.

## Release Objectives
- Deliver an end-to-end orchestration workflow that prepares infrastructure, deploys the AI stack and exposes operational monitoring for Sophia.
- Ensure every specialist agent contributes production-ready artefacts with clear ownership and auditable acceptance criteria.
- Provide the governance hooks (security, compliance, rollback) needed to deploy safely onto Spark hardware.

| Managed MongoDB/PostgreSQL Stack | Infrastructure-as-code recipes for transactional storage. | Lumina | Helm/chart or Terraform plans validated; connection health checks logged in deployment report. |
| Vector Knowledge Base | Configurable FAISS/Pinecone module for semantic search with sync jobs. | Lumina | `nova/task_queue` integration test returns relevant embeddings in <200 ms; indexing runbook documented. |
| Data Governance & Retention | Policies for data retention, encryption and GDPR alignment. | Lumina | Policy document approved; automated retention tests succeed for sample datasets. |

### 4. Interaction & Experience Layer (Echo)
| Feature | Description | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ACE Stack Enablement | Installable Riva, Audio2Face and NeMo assets with compatibility verification. | Echo | Compatibility matrix published; smoke test uses sample utterance to round-trip audio → text → audio. |
| Avatar Production Pipeline | Omniverse → Audio2Face → Riva workflow with asset management. | Echo | Pipeline script renders sample avatar with documented asset repository structure. |
| Enterprise Communications Bridge | Microsoft Teams (or alt) integration with auth and compliance notes. | Echo | Prototype bot registered; integration checklist approved by IT security. |

### 5. Workflow Automation & Delivery (Chronos)
| Feature | Description | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |

| n8n Automation Hub | Containerised n8n deployment templates with baseline workflows. | Chronos | `docker compose up n8n` succeeds locally; sample workflow file synced to repo. |
| Agent Workflow Orchestration | LangChain ↔ n8n bridge enabling cross-agent tasks with status callbacks. | Chronos | Integration test demonstrates task handoff; status updates visible in orchestrator logs. |
| CI/CD Release Train | GitHub Enterprise + Kubernetes pipeline with gated approvals. | Chronos | CI pipeline definition committed; staging deployment triggered via GitHub Actions. |
| Data Flywheel Automation | Scheduled retraining/data refresh cycles capturing telemetry for continuous improvement. | Chronos | Cron workflow documented; telemetry stored in monitoring stack for two consecutive cycles. |

### 6. Monitoring & Insights (Aura)
| Feature | Description | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grafana Observability Suite | Grafana deployment with Prometheus data sources and alert rules. | Aura | Dashboard JSON exported to repo; alerts tested using simulated incident script. |
| LUX Experience Dashboard | UX dashboards combining operational KPIs, sentiment and avatar telemetry. | Aura | Figma (or equivalent) mockups linked; Grafana panels demonstrate KPI overlays. |
| Efficiency & Sustainability Metrics | Energy/resource tracking with optimisation recommendations. | Aura | KPI definitions documented; efficiency report generated from staged workloads. |
| Sentiment & Emotion Visualisation | Real-time display of user sentiment across sessions. | Aura | Sample dataset visualised; API contract defined for ingestion from interaction layer. |

## Release Management Enablers
- **Definition of Done Alignment:** Each feature references measurable artefacts (scripts, documents, dashboards) to plug into roadmap DoD updates.
- **Security & Compliance Hooks:** All agents feed into the audit trail to satisfy governance checkpoints ahead of Spark migration.
- **Testing Expectations:** Unit/integration tests plus smoke validations are linked to CI to uphold the "Implement test harness and monitoring" milestone.

## Next Actions
1. Map features to milestones in the project board and assign owners per agent.
2. Update roadmap checkmarks once acceptance criteria are verified through working demos or documentation.
3. Use this catalogue as the baseline for release readiness reviews prior to Spark hardware migration.
