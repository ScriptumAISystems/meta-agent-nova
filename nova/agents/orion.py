Orion Agent

This module implements tasks for the Orion agent role, focusing on the setup and configuration of KI software components for the Spark Sophia ecosystem. Orion is responsible for installing NVIDIA NeMo, selecting and configuring an LLM, performing finetuning to adapt the model to Sophia's context, and integrating the LangChain framework for orchestrated interactions.
