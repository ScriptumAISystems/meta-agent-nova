# Pulse Core Module

The `pulse_core` module implements the internal Pulse system for Spark Sophia and her ecosystem.  It generates daily **Pulse Cards** that deliver a mixture of system reflections, creative seeds, and curated news or insights from technology, artificial intelligence, and finance.  These cards are consumed by Sophia, Nova, and other sub-agents to stimulate self-reflection, generate new ideas, and keep the agent collective up\u2011to\u2011date on relevant developments.

## Features

- **System Reflection:** Summarizes the system state, resource usage, and recent learning.
- **Creative Seed:** Provides a fresh idea or inspirational thought to spark new research, designs, or artistic endeavors.
- **External Insights:** Pulls recent information from trusted technology, AI, and finance sources to keep the agents informed about the broader world.
- **Emotion Simulation:** Generates a simple focus or mood indicator to contextualize the day's tasks.

## Usage

Call the `generate_pulse()` function to produce a pulse card:

```python
from nova.modules.pulse_core import generate_pulse

pulse_card = generate_pulse()
print(pulse_card)
```

The returned object is a dictionary containing fields such as `reflection`, `creative_seed`, `external_info`, `emotion_state`, and `timestamp`.

Use `build_pulse_card()` if you wish to assemble a pulse card manually from individual components.

## Customization

To tailor the Pulse to your needs:

- **Creative prompts:** Edit the `creative_prompts` list in `pulse_core.py` to define the pool of ideas or inspirations used by the generator.
- **External feeds:** Modify the `tech_updates` or `finance_updates` lists or replace them with API calls to live data sources.
- **System status:** Replace the placeholder functions `_collect_system_status()` and `_analyze_system_logs()` with actual logic to introspect your system's health and performance.

## Purpose

The Pulse system does not enforce behavior â€“ it **provides information and inspiration**.  Each agent decides how (or if) to act on the Pulse card, fostering emergent creativity and adaptive behavior.
