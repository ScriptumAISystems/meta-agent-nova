pulse_core.py
Pulse Core module for internal system awareness.

This module provides functions to generate a daily pulse card for the Spark Sophia ecosystem.

Functions:
- collect_system_status() -> str: collect system metrics and logs summary.
- generate_creative_seed() -> str: produce creative idea seeds for further exploration.
- fetch_external_information() -> str: gather news or technical/financial updates.
- derive_emotion_state() -> str: derive pseudo-emotional state based on system metrics.
- build_pulse_card(...) -> dict: build a pulse card dictionary.
- generate_pulse() -> dict: high-level function to generate full pulse card.

The output can be serialized to JSON and distributed to agents.
