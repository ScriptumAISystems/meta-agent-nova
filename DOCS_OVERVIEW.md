## Bridge & Agent Strategy
This document summarises the security, communication and governance model for Nova and the Spark Sophia ecosystem. It describes roles (Christian, Sophia, Spark Sophia, Nova/Worker agents), the trust model, mTLS connections, token rotation, Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies, a kill‑switch, WORM logging, offline robustness, and the whitelisted categories of operations (file ops, repo ops, doc ops, model ops, script ops and net ops). See `Bridge_Agent_Strategy_summary.md` for details.

## Agent Tasks Overview
This document summarises the tasks for each agent role — Nova, Orion, Lumina, Echo, Chronos and Aura — as extracted from the CSV file.

See `Agenten_Aufgaben_Uebersicht_summary.md` for a full list.

## Tasks List
The file `TASKS.md` consolidates all tasks across agents into one location. Use this list to track progress and plan the implementation of Nova and its sub‑agents.
